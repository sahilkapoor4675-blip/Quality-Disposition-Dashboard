# V46 — Intro fixes

## 1. Intro no longer goes blank after the video

Root cause was in the media asset, not the page code. The source clip
`quality_nonferrous_intro_light.mp4` was 10.0s long and its last ~1.0s washed the
whole composition out to white and then faded to black. The old script froze the
player on its "last visible frame", but that frame *was* the black one — so the
screen went dark the moment playback finished.

Fixes:

- The clip is re-encoded and trimmed to **8.70s**, dropping the wash-out/fade-to-black
  entirely (audio gets a 0.6s fade-out so the cut isn't abrupt). The final frame is now
  the fully composed end state: logo, QUALITY / TRACEABILITY / CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT,
  NON-FERROUS, the tagline, Cupronickel Division, QUALITY INTELLIGENCE, the QCR / RCA /
  DATA cards and the ENTER DASHBOARD button.
- New asset `quality_nonferrous_intro_endcard.png` — a pixel-exact copy of that final
  frame — is layered over the `<video>` and fades in the instant playback stops. Freezing
  no longer depends on the browser retaining a decoded frame, which is what made the
  behaviour inconsistent across browsers. It is also wired up as the `poster`, so there is
  no black flash on load and the composition still shows if autoplay is blocked outright.
- `.intro-stage` now creates its own stacking context (`z-index:1; isolation:isolate`) so
  the ambient glow, the two sweep lines and the drifting particles animate **above** the
  frozen end-card instead of being covered by it. Background motion continues; the video
  plays once and stops.
- Freeze is now driven by `timeupdate` (duration − 0.08s), with `ended`, `pause`, `error`
  and a duration-based timeout as fallbacks, so the end-card appears even if the clip
  stalls. The video never loops or restarts.

## 2. "Cupronickel Division" sat on top of the divider line

This was baked into the video frames, which is why earlier CSS-side attempts had no
effect. The orange rule was running straight through the text like a strike-through.

- The affected band is repaired at the frame level: the region is cleaned, the division
  name is re-rendered at its original size, colour and centre, and the orange rule is
  moved **below** it as a proper underline (y 352–355, x 490–790).
- The repair is composited into the video from 1.53s (matching when the rule originally
  appeared) through to the end, so it is correct during playback as well as on the
  frozen end-card.

## 3. Intro hint legibility

`CLICK ENTER DASHBOARD TO CONTINUE` was near-white. That was readable only because the
intro used to end on black; against the light composition it was invisible. It is now
dark slate, shifting to brand orange with a soft pulse once the video has stopped.

## Files touched

- `quality_nonferrous_intro_light.mp4` (re-encoded, 8.70s)
- `quality_nonferrous_intro_endcard.png` (new)
- `index.html` (intro styles, end-card markup, freeze logic)
- `server.py` (end-card added to the static asset allow-list)

# V46.1 — Deploy fix: port scan timeout

The build succeeded but the deploy was cancelled with
`Port scan timeout reached, no open ports detected`. The process was alive the whole
time — it just never got as far as binding a socket.

`main()` ran `_ensure_admin_schema()`, `_seed_postgres_if_empty()` and
`ensure_fast_indexes()` **before** constructing the server. Against an external Postgres
on a cold database that is not quick work: the seed inserts every historical row and
`CREATE INDEX` on a populated table takes real time. The host gave up waiting for a
listening port and cancelled the deploy long before any of it finished.

Changes:

- `main()` now binds and starts serving first. All schema/seed/index work moved into
  `_run_startup_tasks()`, which runs on a background thread. The port opens in about a
  second regardless of how slow the database is. Verified locally: healthy response at
  +2s on SQLite, and with a deliberately unreachable `DATABASE_URL` the port still opens
  immediately and the failure is logged instead of blocking the boot.
- Each startup task is individually wrapped, timed and logged, so a failure in one no
  longer stops the other two and the log shows exactly which step is slow.
- New `/healthz` (and `/readyz`) endpoint — first route checked, touches no database, no
  auth, no disk. Returns `{ok, ready, startup_error, backend}`. Wired up as Render's
  `healthCheckPath`.
- Startup logging is line-buffered and `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` is set in `render.yaml`.
  Previously stdout was buffered, which is why the failed deploy log showed no output
  from the app at all and a slow boot looked identical to a silent one.
- `render.yaml` gains an explicit `buildCommand`.

Note: the build log shows cp314 wheels, so the host is using Python 3.14 and ignoring
`runtime.txt` (which asks for 3.11.9). Everything installed and parses fine on 3.14, so
this is informational — but if you want the pinned version, set it in the service's
environment settings rather than `runtime.txt`.
